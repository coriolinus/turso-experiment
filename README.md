# Turso Experiment

How far can we get writing a TODO application that works both on the command line and the internet, backed by Turso?

## Notes and Findings

1. Migrations are a pain and we may have to write our own migration framework
    - `refinery` has no native support for Turso
    - and bringing in `rusqlite` only for purpose of migrations is silly, and will likely fail once we encrypt the database
    - so we introduce a connection wrapper, whatever
    - but the traits `refinery` uses are only sync, and `turso` is async-first
    - and we can't just `smol::block_on` because `block_on` is illegal in a wasm context
2. Getting a rowset is annoyingly manual
    - [`Rows`](https://docs.rs/turso/0.4.4/turso/struct.Rows.html) has an annoyingly manual interface: just `async fn next`, no iterator or map combinators
    - Can't get a value by column name, only by column index
    - `query_row` returns no error if more than one row is returned
3. Encryption is a planned feature, but it's experimental for now at least.
4. Builder feels underbaked: path argument is `&str` not `impl AsRef<Path>`.
5. We still occasionally encounter TODO items in the library
    - `Parse error: TODO: parenthesized expression with multiple arguments not yet supported` from `RETURNING (id, created_at)`.
        - Though that might have been an sql error anyway
6. Ultimately in the native context it appears to work, at least for simple cases.
    I would not yet call it ready for prime time in this context due to its various rough edges, but there's clear and substantial progress since last we looked at it.
7. Some features don't fail but also don't work:
    - `ON DELETE CASCADE` doesn't cascade.
